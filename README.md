# NextGen-Hydroponics-Indoor
Code for UT Austin research group NextGen Hydroponics indoor hydroponics system

Main code is contained in the sensor_controller_v1.ino file. The libraries subfolder contains third-party libraries for controlling the sensors.

10/25/20: Initial commit. Includes basica functionality such as reading sensor data and manually pressing the buttons on the irrigation timer. Still needs to be updated with accurate initial EC values and add water pump functionality via a relay system.
